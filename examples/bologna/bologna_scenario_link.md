# The Bologna scenario

A realistic large scale rush hour scenario of Bologna, Italy with a syntetic population.

A description of this scenario has been published on ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information:

Schweizer, J.; Poliziani, C.; Rupi, F.; Morgano, D.; Magi, M. Building a Large-Scale Micro-Simulation Transport Scenario Using Big Data. ISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2021, 10, 165. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10030165


Due to the file size limitations on github, the Bologna scenario has been copied to Google's Onedrive. Please download from there, just by following this link:

The README.txt text file explains how to run and explore the scenario with SUMOPy or just with a working SUMO installation.

Have fun,
